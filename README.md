## 🌟 What We're Building

PredictHub solves the fragmentation problem in the prediction market ecosystem. Instead of visiting multiple platforms, users can:

- **Discover** markets from 3+ platforms in one place
- **Compare** prices, volumes, and liquidity across platforms
- **Analyze** market trends with professional-grade charts
- **Trade** seamlessly with direct links to each platform

### The Problem We're Solving

1. **Fragmentation**: Prediction markets are scattered across multiple platforms
2. **Discovery**: Hard to find the best markets and opportunities
3. **Comparison**: No easy way to compare similar markets across platforms
4. **Data Access**: Each platform has different APIs and data formats
5. **User Experience**: Inconsistent interfaces across platforms

### Our Solution

A unified, beautiful aggregator that brings everything together with:
- Real-time data synchronization
- Cross-platform search and filtering
- Professional analytics and charts
- Seamless platform integration

## 🚧 Challenges Solved

### 1. **API Inconsistencies**
**Problem**: Each platform has different API structures, field names, and data formats.  
**Solution**: Built a normalization layer that transforms all APIs into a unified `PredictionMarket` type.

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
**Problem**: Polymarket CLOB API has strict rate limits.  
**Solution**: Implemented smart caching, request queuing, and fallback to mock data when needed.

### 3. **Sparse Price Data**
**Problem**: Some markets only have 2 data points, creating flat line charts.  
**Solution**: Built interpolation algorithm that generates 50 smooth data points from sparse data.

### 4. **SSR Hydration Errors**
**Problem**: Date formatting differences between server and client.  
**Solution**: Created SSR-safe date formatting function with consistent output.

### 5. **Type Safety**
**Problem**: Different platforms have different market properties.  
**Solution**: Used TypeScript discriminated unions and Zod schemas for runtime validation.

### 6. **Platform URL Formats**
**Problem**: Polymarket changed from `/event/` to `/market/` URL structure.  
**Solution**: Updated all URL construction to use correct format with fallbacks.
